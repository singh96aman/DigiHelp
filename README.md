# DigiHelp

In the age of Automation, Even now patients are required to produce previous medical records for better assessment. One solution to this ever growing problem is to catalog all medical health records of a patient so that the consultation can be automized.

DigiHelp was created so that patients can easily view their medical records (Using a built in PDF Viewer). Later, Support for OCR was included using Azure Computer Vision so that patients can scan their medical records and it can be stored in the system database. 

DigiHelp is an Open Sourced Software. Please contribute !

Currently, DigiHelp is switching from Azure Computer Vision to Google Computer Vision for better and more accurate results.
